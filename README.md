The function in the mark_abm.R file implements the Agent-Based Model from Noah Mark's 1998 paper "Beyond Individual Differences: Social Differentiation from First Principles" in the American Sociological Review.

Right now the function takes a very long time to run, and I'm looking for help in speeding up its implementation.
